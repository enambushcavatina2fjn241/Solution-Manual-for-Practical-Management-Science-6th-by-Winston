  * Learn to take full advantage of the power of spreadsheet modeling with PRACTICAL MANAGEMENT SCIENCE, 6E, geared entirely to Excel 2016. This edition uses an active-learning approach and realistic problems with the right amount of theory to ensure you establish a strong foundation. Exercises offer practical, hands-on experience with the methodologies. Examples and problems from finance, marketing, and operations management, and other areas of business illustrate how management science applies to your chosen profession -- and how you can use these skills on the job. The authors emphasize modeling rather than algebraic formulations and memorization of particular models.
